# ================================

Analyze the content gap for this sub-intent based on competitor AI Overview patterns and Judge Agent analysis.

SUB-INTENT: {sub_intent}
COMPETITOR_PATTERNS: {competitor_patterns}
OPTIMIZATION_TARGET: {optimization_target}
JUDGE_AGENT_ANALYSIS: {judge_analysis}
ING CONTEXT: Digital banking leader in Europe, focus on customer experience and innovation

Enhanced gap analysis requirements:
1. What content is missing that could trigger AIO inclusion (based on Judge Agent ranking)
2. How competitors structure successful AIO content (validated by reranker scores)
3. ING's unique positioning opportunity for this sub-intent
4. Specific content format recommendations from Judge Agent top performers
5. Content gaps that ING can fill better than competitors
6. Semantic similarity opportunities identified by Judge Agent
7. Reranking optimization strategies based on successful content patterns

JUDGE AGENT INSIGHTS TO CONSIDER:
- Current ranking position vs competitors
- Reranker score performance analysis
- Semantic similarity gaps with ground truth content
- Successful content structure patterns from training data
- Competitive weaknesses identified in hybrid search results

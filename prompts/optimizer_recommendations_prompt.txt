Generate specific, actionable content optimization recommendations for AI Overview inclusion.

CONTENT_ANALYSIS: {content_analysis}
TARGET_QUERY: {target_query}
SUB_INTENT: {sub_intent}
JUDGE_EVALUATION: {judge_evaluation}
COMPETITOR_DATA: {competitor_data}
CURRENT_PERFORMANCE: {current_performance}

Based on the Judge Agent analysis and content evaluation, provide detailed optimization recommendations that will improve AI Overview inclusion probability.

ANALYSIS CONTEXT:
- Current AI Overview inclusion probability: {current_probability}%
- Content ranking position: #{content_rank}
- Reranker score: {reranker_score}
- Top competitors identified: {competitor_count}
- Content gaps identified: {gap_count}

Generate recommendations that:
1. Address specific ranking weaknesses identified by Judge Agent
2. Improve content structure for better reranker performance
3. Enhance semantic similarity with successful AI Overview content
4. Provide competitive advantages over identified competitors
5. Include specific implementation guidance and effort estimates
6. Prioritize recommendations by expected impact on inclusion probability
